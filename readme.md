# CRS Modules

## Introduction

CRS modules allows you to define modules based on keys.  
The aim is to load modules only when required.  
Under normal conditions you would just use the import language feature.  
When working with schema driven UI however you may want to have something that will dynamically load modules based on the features defined in the modules.

This library aims to be used along side packages such as crs-schema and crs-components for the above example.
